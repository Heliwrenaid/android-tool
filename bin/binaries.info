SAT needs to use mainly two binaries:
-simg2img
-img2simg

If you can't install these packages using any package manager, then try to use below:
https://github.com/anestisb/android-simg2img

Instructions:
1. git clone https://github.com/anestisb/android-simg2img.git or download archive from releases
2. cd android-simg2img
3. run "make". As a result you should get simg2img and img2simg binaries (if necessary rename it to this names).
4. Move binaries to "bin" folder in SAT directory
5. chmod u+x simg2img img2simg
6. Finally add/modify value in default.conf file: use_tool_binaries=true
