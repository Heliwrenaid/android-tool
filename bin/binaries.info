SAT needs to use mainly two binaries:
-simg2img
-img2simg

If u can't install these packages using any package manager, then search and find it manually.
When you found it, place to this "bin" folder, and rename as mentioned to "simg2img" and "img2simg".
Run below commands:
chmod u+x simg2img
chmod u+x img2simg
To force the SAT to use this binaries just add/modify below line in default.conf file:
use_tool_binaries=true
